# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-Using-MNIST-Dataset

## Project Overview:

This project focuses on building a neural network from scratch, aiming to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Rather than using high-level machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, the network is developed using only basic Python libraries like NumPy. This approach demonstrates a deep understanding of how neural networks operate at a low level, including key processes such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization.

### Dataset :

The dataset used is the MNIST dataset, a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. It consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples, with each example being a grayscale image of a digit from 0 to 9, represented in a 28x28 pixel grid. To simplify the input, each image was flattened into a one-dimensional vector of 784 pixels.
